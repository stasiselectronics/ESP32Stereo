# Designing a battery powered ESP32 Stereo

I want a small board that is acting like a bluetooth speaker. Where it can power 2 speakers of medium size. I think the goal is comfortable in a living room.

I also want to have an extra audio input for a tv.

It should be battery powered and easy to integrate with speakers with bare wires or ferules

The screw terminals I have previoulsy bought haven't been holding up that well. So maybe a set of nice screw terminals

I think the basic features that should be on there I can copy from batteryboost:
5V Micro USB connector
Maybe USB C?

Can I make a diagram of the systems?
