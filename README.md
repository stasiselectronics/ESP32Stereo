Included in the project is a Jekyll static site written to provide more space to document the technical design.

The site exists as a separate branch to this repository, and is titled "gh-pages"

You can view the [template's github page](https://stasiselectronics.github.io/KiCAD-Project-Template/) to get a better understanding of where to get started.

The site is using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) theme for jekyll. It is designed, developed, and maintained by [Michael Rose](https://mademistakes.com/about/) from Buffalo New York.
